                <p>
                    The name Baguio conjures, for both the international and domestic traveler, a highland retreat in the Grand Cordillera in Northern Luzon, with pine trees, crisp cold breezes and low verdant knolls and hillocks. Through the numerous decades Baguio has
                    morphed from what was once a grassy marshland into one of the cleanest and greenest, most highly urbanized cities in the country. It has made its mark as a premiere tourist destination in the Northern part of the Philippines with its
                    cool climate, foggy hills, panoramic views and lovely flowers.

                        beach and island destination – Magalawa island.To welcome the Chinese New Year and help my friends do their maternity shoot, we headed to Zambales and enjoyed every minute of it.
